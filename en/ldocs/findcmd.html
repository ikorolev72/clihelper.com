	<h1> A Unix/Linux <q>find</q> Command Tutorial </h1>
<h2 class="hide">&nbsp;</h2>

<div><h2> Locating Files: </h2></div>

<p>
The <code>find</code> command is used to locate files on a Unix
or Linux system.&nbsp;
<code>find</code> will search any set of directories you specify
for files that match the supplied <em>search criteria</em>.&nbsp;
You can search for files by name, owner, group, type, permissions,
date, and other criteria.&nbsp;
The search is recursive in that it will search all subdirectories
too.&nbsp;
The syntax looks like this:
</p>

<pre class="Indent">
find <em>where-to-look criteria what-to-do</em></pre>

<p>
All arguments to <code>find</code> are optional, and there are
defaults for all parts.&nbsp;
(This may depend on which version of <code>find</code> is used.&nbsp;
Here we discuss the freely available GNU version of <code>find</code>,
which is the version available on <code>YborStudent</code>.)&nbsp;
For example <code><em>where-to-look</em></code>
defaults to <code>.</code> (that is, the current working directory),
<code><em>criteria</em></code> defaults to none (that is, show all
files), and <code><em>what-to-do</em></code>
(known as the <code>find</code> <em>action</em>)
defaults to <code>-print</code> (that is, display found files to
standard output).
</p>

<p>
For example:
</p>

<pre class="Indent">
find</pre>

<p>
will display all files in the current directory and all
subdirectories.&nbsp;
The commands
</p>

<pre class="Indent">
find . -print
find -print
find .</pre>

<p>
do the exact same thing.&nbsp;
Here's an example <code>find</code> command using a search criteria
and the default action:
</p>

<pre class="Indent">
find / -name foo</pre>
<p>
will search the whole system for any files named <code>foo</code>
and display them.&nbsp;
Here we are using the criteria <code>-name</code> with the argument
<code>foo</code> to tell <code>find</code> to perform a name search
for the filename <code>foo</code>.&nbsp;
The output might look like this:
</p>

<pre class="Indent">
/home/wpollock/foo
/home/ua02/foo
/tmp/foo</pre>

<p>
If <code>find</code> doesn't locate any matching files, it produces
no output.
</p>

<p>
The above example said to search the whole system, by
specifying the root directory (<q><code>/</code></q>)
to search.&nbsp;
If you don't run this command as root, <code>find</code> will
display a error message for each directory on which you don't
have read permission.&nbsp;
This can be a lot of messages, and the matching files that are
found may scroll right off your screen.&nbsp;
A good way to deal with this problem is to redirect the error
messages so you don't have to see them at all:
</p>

<pre class="Indent">
find / -name foo <strong>2&gt;/dev/null</strong></pre>

<p>
You can specify as many places to search as you wish:
</p>

<pre class="Indent">
find /tmp /var/tmp . $HOME -name foo</pre>


<h2> Other Features And Applications: </h2>

<p>
The <q><code>-print</code></q> action lists the files separated by
a space when the output is <em>piped</em> to another command.&nbsp;
This can lead to a problem if any found files contain spaces in
their names, as the output doesn't use any quoting.&nbsp;
In such cases, when the output of <code>find</code> contains a file
name such as <q><code>foo&nbsp;bar</code></q> and is piped into
another command, that command <q>sees</q> two file names, not one
file name containing a space.
</p>

<p>
In such cases you can specify the action <q><code>-print0</code></q>
instead, which lists the found files separated not with a space,
but with a <em>null</em> character (which is not a legal character
in Unix or Linux file names).&nbsp;
Of course the command that reads the output of <code>find</code>
must be able to handle such a list of file names.&nbsp;  Many
commands commonly used with <code>find</code> (such as
<code>tar</code> or <code>cpio</code>) have special options to
read in file names separated with NULLs instead of spaces.
</p>

<p>
You can use shell-style wildcards in the <code>-name</code> search
argument:
</p>

<pre class="Indent">
find . -name foo\*bar</pre>

<p>
This will search from the current directory down for foo*bar
(that is, any filename that begins with <code>foo</code> and
ends with <code>bar</code>).&nbsp;
Note that wildcards in the name argument
must be quoted so the shell doesn't expand them before passing them
to <code>find</code>.&nbsp;
Also, unlike regular shell wildcards, these will match leading
periods in filenames.&nbsp;
(For example <q><code>find&nbsp;-name&nbsp;\*.txt</code></q>.)
</p>

<p>
You can search for other criteria beside the name.&nbsp;
Also you can list multiple search criteria.&nbsp;
When you have multiple criteria any found files must match all
listed criteria.&nbsp;
That is, there is an implied Boolean <em>AND</em> operator
between the listed search criteria.&nbsp;
<code>find</code> also allows <em>OR</em> and <em>NOT</em> Boolean
operators, as well as grouping, to combine search criteria in
powerful ways (not shown here.)
</p>

<p>
Here's an example using two search criteria:
</p>

<pre class="Indent">
find / <strong>-type f -mtime -7</strong> | xargs tar -rf weekly_incremental.tar
gzip weekly_incremental.tar</pre>
<p>
will find any regular files (i.e., not directories or other special files)
with the criteria <q><code>-type&nbsp;f</code></q>, and only those
modified seven or fewer days ago
(<q><code>-mtime&nbsp;-7</code></q>).&nbsp;
Note the use of <code>xargs</code>, a handy utility that coverts a
stream of input (in this case the output of <code>find</code>) into
command line arguments for the supplied command (in this case
<code>tar</code>, used to create a backup archive).
</p>

<p class="boxed">
Using the <code>tar</code> option <q><code>-c</code></q>
is dangerous here;&nbsp;
<code>xargs</code> may invoke <code>tar</code> several times if
there are many files found and each <q><code>-c</code></q> will
cause <code>tar</code> to over-write the previous invocation.&nbsp;
The <q><code>-r</code></q> option <em>appends</em> files to an
archive.&nbsp;
Other options such as those that would permit filenames containing
spaces would be useful in a <q>production quality</q> backup script.
</p>

<p>
<a name="xargs"></a>
Another use of <code>xargs</code> is illustrated below.&nbsp;
This command will efficiently remove all files named
<code>core</code> from your system (provided you run the command
as root of course):
</p>

<pre class="Indent">
find / -name core | xargs /bin/rm -f
find / -name core -exec /bin/rm -f '{}' \; # same thing
find / -name core -delete                  # same if using Gnu find
</pre>

<p>
(The last two forms run the <code>rm</code> command once per file,
and are not as efficient as the first form.)
</p>

<p>
One of my favorite <code>find</code> criteria is to locate files
modified less than 10 minutes ago.&nbsp;
I use this right after using some system administration
tool, to learn which files got changed by that tool:
</p>

<pre class="Indent">
find / -mmin -10</pre>

<p>
(This search is also useful when I've downloaded some file but
can't locate it.)
</p>

<p>
Another common use is to locate all files owned by a given user
(<q><code>-user&nbsp;<em>username</em></code></q>).&nbsp;
This is useful when deleting user accounts.
</p>

<p>
You can also find files with various permissions set.&nbsp;
<q><code>-perm&nbsp;/<em>permissions</em></code></q> means to find
files with <strong>any</strong> of the specified <em>permissions</em>
on, <q><code>-perm&nbsp;-<em>permissions</em></code></q> means to
find files with <strong>all</strong> of the specified
<em>permissions</em> on, and
<q><code>-perm&nbsp;<em>permissions</em></code></q> means to
find files with <strong>exactly</strong> <em>permissions</em>.&nbsp;
<em>Permisisons</em> can be specified either symbolically (preferred)
or with an octal number.&nbsp;
The following will locate files that are writeable by <q>others</q>
(including symlinks, which should be writeable by all):
</p>

<pre class="Indent">
find . -perm -o=w</pre>

<p>
(Using <code>-perm</code> is more complex than this example
shows.&nbsp;
You should check both the 
<a href="http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/find.html#tag_04_55_04">
POSIX documentation for <code>find</code></a>
(which explains how the symbolic modes work) and the
Gnu <code>find</code> man page (which describes the Gnu extensions).
</p>

<p>
When using <code>find</code> to locate files for backups, it often
pays to use the <q><code>-depth</code></q> option (really a criteria
that is always true), which forces the
output to be <em>depth-first</em>&mdash;that is, files first
and then the directories containing them.&nbsp;
This helps when the directories have restrictive permissions,
and restoring the directory first could prevent the files from
restoring at all (and would change the time stamp on the directory
in any case).&nbsp;
Normally, <code>find</code> returns the directory first, before any
of the files in that directory.&nbsp;
This is useful when using the <q><code>-prune</code></q> action to
prevent <code>find</code> from examining any files you want to
ignore:
</p>

<pre class="Indent">
find / -name /dev -prune | xargs tar ...
</pre>

<p>
When specifying time with <code>find</code> options such as
<code>-mmin</code> (minutes) or <code>-mtime</code> (24 hour
periods, starting from now), you can specify a number
<q><code><em>n</em></code></q> to mean exactly
<code><em>n</em></code>, <q><code><em>-n</em></code></q>
to mean less than <code><em>n</em></code>, and
<q><code><em>+n</em></code></q> to mean more than
<code><em>n</em></code>.
</p>

<p class="boxed">
Fractional 24-hour periods are truncated!&nbsp;
That means that <q><code>find&nbsp;-mtime&nbsp;+1</code></q> says
to match files modified <strong>two or more days ago.</strong>
</p>

<p>
For example:
</p>
<pre class="Indent">
find . -mtime 0   # find files modified between now and 1 day ago
                  # (i.e., within the past 24 hours)
find . -mtime -1  # find files modified less than 1 day ago
                  # (i.e., within the past 24 hours, as before)
find . -mtime 1   # find files modified between 24 and 48 hours ago
find . -mtime +1  # find files modified more than 48 hours ago

find . -mmin +5 -mmin -10 # find files modifed between
                          # 6 and 9 minutes ago
</pre>
<p>
Using the <q><code>-printf</code></q> action instead of the default
<q><code>-print</code></q> is useful to control the
output format better than you can with <code>ls</code> or
<code>dir</code>.&nbsp;
You can use <code>find</code> with <code>-printf</code> to produce
output that can easily be parsed by other utilities, or imported
into spreadsheets or databases.&nbsp;
(See the man page for the dozens
of possibilities with the <code>-printf</code> action.)&nbsp;
The following displays non-hidden (no leading dot) files in the
current directory only (no subdirectories),
with an custom output format:
</p>

<pre class="Indent">
find . -maxdepth 1 -name '[!.]*' -printf 'Name: %16f Size: %6s\n'
</pre>

<p>
(<q><code>-maxdepth</code></q> is a Gnu extension.)
</p>

<p>
As a system administrator you can use <code>find</code> to locate
suspicious files (e.g., world writable files, files with no valid
owner and/or group, SetUID files, files with unusual permissions,
sizes, names, or dates).&nbsp;
Here's a final more complex example (which I save as a shell
script):
</p>

<pre class="Indent">
find / -noleaf -wholename '/proc' -prune \
     -o -wholename '/sys' -prune \
     -o -wholename '/dev' -prune \
     -o -wholename '/windows-C-Drive' -prune \
     -o -perm -2 ! -type l  ! -type s \
     ! \( -type d -perm -1000 \) -print
</pre>

<p>
This says to seach the whole system, skipping the directories
<code>/proc</code>, <code>/sys</code>, <code>/dev</code>, and
<code>/windows-C-Drive</code> (presumably a Windows partition on
a dual-booted computer).&nbsp;
The Gnu <code>-noleaf</code> option tells <code>find</code> not
to assume all remaining mounted filesystems are Unix file systems
(you might have a mounted <acronym>CD</acronym> for instance).&nbsp;
The <q><code>-o</code></q> is the Boolean OR operator, and
<q><code>!</code></q> is the Boolean NOT operator (applies to the
following criteria).
</p>

<p>
So this criteria says to locate files that are world writable
(<q><code>-perm&nbsp;-2</code></q>, same as <q><code>-o=w</code></q>)
and NOT symlinks
(<q><code>!&nbsp;-type&nbsp;l</code></q>) and NOT <em>sockets</em>
(<q><code>!&nbsp;-type&nbsp;s</code></q>)
and NOT directories with the <em>sticky</em> (or <em>text</em>)
bit set
(<q><code>!&nbsp;\(&nbsp;-type&nbsp;d&nbsp;-perm&nbsp;-1000 \)<!--
--></code></q>).&nbsp;
(Symlinks, sockets and directories with the sticky bit set are often
world-writable and generally not suspicious.)
</p>

<p>
A common request is a way to find all the hard links to
some file.&nbsp;
Using <q><code>ls&nbsp;-li&nbsp;<em>file</em></code></q> will
tell you how many hard links the file has, and the
<em>inode number</em>.&nbsp;
You can locate all pathnames to this file with:
</p>

<pre>
  find <em>mount-point</em> -xdev -inum <em>inode-number</em>
</pre>

<p>
Since hard links are restricted to a single filesystem, you need
to search that whole filesystem so you start the search at the
filesystem's <em>mount point</em>.&nbsp;
(This is likely to be either <q><code>/home</code></q> or
<q><code>/</code></q> for files in your home directory.)&nbsp;
The <q><code>-xdev</code></q> options tells <code>find</code>
to not search any other filesystems.
</p>

<p>
(While most Unix and all Linux systems have a <code>find</code>
command that supports the <q><code>-inum</code></q> criteria,
this isn't POSIX standard.&nbsp;
Older Unix systems provided the <q><code>ncheck</code></q>
utility instead that could be used for this.)
</p>

<h2> Using <code>-exec</code> Efficiently: </h2>

<p>
The <code>-exec</code> option to <code>find</code> is great, but
since it runs the command listed for every found file, it isn't
very efficient.&nbsp;
On a large system this makes a difference!&nbsp;
One solution is to combine <code>find</code> with
<code>xargs</code> as discussed <a href="#xargs">above</a>:
</p>

<pre>
  find <em>whatever...</em> | xargs <em>command</em></pre>

<p>
However this approach has two limitations.&nbsp;
Firstly not all commands accept the
list of files at the end of the command.&nbsp;
A good example is <code>cp</code>:
</p>

<pre class="Indent">
find . -name \*.txt | xargs cp /tmp  # This won't work!
</pre>

<p>
(Note the Gnu version of <code>cp</code> has a non-POSIX
option <q><code>-t</code></q> for this.)
</p>

<p>
Secondly filenames may contain spaces or newlines, which would
confuse the command used with <code>xargs</code>.&nbsp;
(Again Gnu tools have options for that,
<q><code>find&nbsp;...&nbsp;-print0&nbsp;<!--
-->|xargs&nbsp;-0&nbsp;...</code></q>.)
</p>

<p>
There are POSIX (but non-obvious) solutions to both problems.&nbsp;
An alternate form of <code>-exec</code> ends with a plus-sign, not a
semi-colon.&nbsp;
This form collects the filenames into groups or sets, and runs the
command once per set.&nbsp;
(This is exactly what <code>xargs</code> does, to prevent argument
lists from becoming too long for the system to handle.)&nbsp;
In this form the <code>{}</code> argument expands to the set of
filenames.&nbsp;
For example:
</p>

<pre class="Indent">
find / -name core -exec /bin/rm -f '{}' +</pre>

<p>
This form of <code>-exec</code> can be combined with a shell
feature to solve the other problem (names with spaces).&nbsp;
The POSIX shell allows us to use:
</p>

<pre class="Indent">
sh -c '<em>command-line</em>' [ <em>command-name</em> <!--
-->[ <em>args</em>... ] ]</pre>

<p>
<a name="fn3Src"></a>
(We don't usually care about the <em>command-name</em>, so <q>X</q>,
<q>dummy</q>, or <q>inline cmd</q> is often used.)&nbsp;
Here's an example of efficiently copying found files, in a
POSIX-compliant way
(Posted on 
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.unix.shell/">
comp.unix.shell</a> netnews newsgroup on Oct. 28 2007 by
Stephane CHAZELAS):
</p>

<pre class="Indent">
find . -name '*.txt' -type f \
  -exec sh -c 'exec cp -f "$@" /tmp' find-copy {} +</pre>

<p>
The <code>find</code> command can be amazingly useful.&nbsp;
See the man page to learn all the criteria and options you can use.
